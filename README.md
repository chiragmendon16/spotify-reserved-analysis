# Spotify Reserved Analysis

> A data analytics and business intelligence project examining Spotify's newly launched Reserved feature — a superfan ticketing programme that uses streaming behaviour to allocate concert tickets to an artist's most dedicated listeners.

**Tools:** Python · Pandas · Scikit-learn · Spotify Web API · Tableau · SQL  
**Type:** Data Analysis · Business Analysis · Product Analytics  
**Status:** Phase 1 Complete — Phase 2 In Progress  

---

## Project Overview

On May 21 2026, Spotify announced **Reserved** at its Investor Day — a feature for Premium subscribers that identifies superfans based on listening behaviour (streams, saves, shares) and holds two concert tickets for them before general public sale, in partnership with Live Nation.

This project answers 7 core business questions about how Reserved works, how it should be measured, and what risks and opportunities exist as it scales.

## Business Questions

| # | Question | Analysis type |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | What listening signals most strongly predict superfan status? | Scoring model |
| Q2 | How could Spotify improve the Reserved experience beyond ticket access? | Product analysis |
| Q3 | What structural fairness risks exist in the eligibility model? | Bias analysis |
| Q4 | How does Spotify collect and score behavioural signals for each user? | Data architecture |
| Q5 | How does the model perform at A-list scale (BTS, Weeknd, Beyoncé)? | Stress test |
| Q6 | Does a Reserved offer improve 90-day Premium subscriber retention? | Retention analysis |
| Q7 | What is the revenue uplift for artists and venues from Reserved? | Financial model |

---

## Key Findings *(updated as analysis progresses)*

- Superfan scoring model built using 6 behavioural signals; top 5% engagement tier maps to Reserved eligibility
- Artist segmentation reveals 4 distinct tiers with materially different superfan density profiles
- A-list stress test: for a 60,000-seat stadium artist, Reserved allocation is a ~300:1 competition among eligible fans
- Retention hypothesis: a 5% improvement in 90-day Premium retention = ~$193M incremental ARR at current subscriber base
- 6 product enhancement recommendations for Reserved v2.0 identified
